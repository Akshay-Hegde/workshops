Abstract
--------

The website http://workshops.opengeo.org is hosted on WEDGE, and is built 
from Sphinx projects saved in Subversion using a Perl script.  Running 
the script will build each Sphinx project using a common theme along 
with a "front page" Sphinx project, and then copy everything into place, 
live, on the site.
