OpenGeo Suite Dashboard
=======================

OpenGeo Suite comes with a Dashboard, a lightweight web application that provides links to the most common applications and documentation.

As we introduce the Dashboard, take some time to explore it by clicking around.

The Dashboard can be opened from the Start menu at :menuselection:`OpenGeo Suite --> Dashboard`. The Dashboard is also available in the browser by navigating to ``http://localhost:8080/``.

Home screen
-----------

The main Dashboard page show links to PostGIS configuration and documentation for PostGIS, GeoServer, GeoWebCache, and GeoExplorer.

.. note:: A link to pgAdmin is not included here because the Dashboard can only launch web pages, not desktop applications. pgAdmin can be launched from the Start Menu.
