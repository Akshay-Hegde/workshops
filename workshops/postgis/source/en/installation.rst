Section 2: Installation
=======================

We will be using OpenGeo Suite as our software package, as it includes PostGIS/PostgreSQL in a single fast installation for Windows, Apple OS/X, and Linux. The Suite also includes GeoServer, OpenLayers, and a number of web visualization utilities.

.. note::

  If you want to install just PostgreSQL, it can also be downloaded directly as source code or binary from the PostgreSQL project site: http://postgresql.org/download/. After installing PostgreSQL, use the "StackBuilder" utility to add the PostGIS extension.

.. note:: 

  The precise directions in this document are for Windows, but for OS/X the installation is largely the same. Once the Suite is installed, the directions for both operating systems should be almost identical.  

#. Find OpenGeo Suite installer for your platform (download from http://boundlessgeo.com/solutions/opengeo-suite/download/). The Windows installer will be named something like  :file:`opengeosuite-3.0.0.exe`, the Mac OSX installer like :file:`opengeosuite-3.0.0.dmg`).  Double click to begin.

#. Enjoy the warm welcome, courtesy of Boundless, then click **Next**.
