Building an application involves managing some state on the client and some on the server, and communicating between the two. This workshop will show:

* Loading working data into PostGIS
* Styling working data with GeoServer
* Creating an OpenLayers application with OpenGeo Suite SDK
* Enhancing an OpenLayers application
* Styling and manipulating geographic features in OpenLAyers
* Using :term:`OGC` web services to feed a web application
