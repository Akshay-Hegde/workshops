Optimizing raster layers in GeoServer 
=====================================

This section presents some of the techniques and tools that are available to improve GeoServer performance when working with **raster data**. Some of these techniques involve altering the data itself, while others consider how the data is structured and organized. Most of these optimizations should result in improved general performance for any applications working with the same data, though there will be some GeoServer-specific settings,
