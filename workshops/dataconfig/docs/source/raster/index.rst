Optimizing raster layers in GeoServer 
=====================================

This section presents some of the techniques and tools that are available to improve GeoServer performance when working with **raster layers**. Some of these techniques involve altering the data itself, while others consider how the data is structured and organized. Although we will cover some GeoServer-specific settings, most of these optimizations should result in improved general performance for other applications working with the same data.
