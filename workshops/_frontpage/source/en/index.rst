Course Materials at OpenGeo
===========================

`OpenGeo <http://opengeo.org/>`_ is a "social enterprise" devoted to building and supporting tools that help organizations share their information online. We believe that access to knowledge is a fundamental good, so we make our training materials available online under an open document license, for everyone to use and reuse.

Tutorials
---------

Tutorials are **practical walk-throughs** of actual application development examples from start to finish, demonstrating different aspects of Suite functionality and the kinds of problems the Suite can solve.

`Building a GeoNames Heat Map <http://workshops.opengeo.org/tutorial-wordmap/>`_ - (`Demo <http://workshops.opengeo.org/tutorial-wordmap/_static/wordmap-full.html>`_)
  This application displays a web-based dynamic heat map, based on querying a database of two million geographic names points for the United States. 


Workshops
---------

The following are actual course materials given at our various `training classes <http://opengeo.org/products/training>`_ in New York City and at conferences around the world.  As our list of courses grows, we will be posting more materials here.

`Introduction to the OpenGeo Suite <http://workshops.opengeo.org/suiteintro/>`_ - (`Download <http://opengeo.org/products/training/materials/>`_)
  This course will introduce attendees to the `OpenGeo Suite <http://opengeo.org/products/suite/>`_, a complete web mapping solution.  The course will include an introduction to spatial analysis with PostGIS, loading and serving data with GeoServer, map optimization with GeoWebCache, styling, composing, and publishing maps with GeoExplorer, and creating your own web map applications with OpenLayers and GeoExt.

`Introduction to PostGIS <http://workshops.opengeo.org/postgis-intro/>`_ - (`Download <http://opengeo.org/products/training/materials/>`_)
  As presented at FOSS4G 2011, this workshop introduces the PostGIS spatial database. Installation, loading data, configuration, spatial SQL queries, indexing, tuning and viewing are among the topics touched on in this overview workshop.

`Introduction to GeoServer <http://workshops.opengeo.org/geoserver-intro/>`_ - (`Download <http://opengeo.org/products/training/materials/>`_)
  Updated for 2013. Learn to load, style, and publish maps and data using GeoServer.

`Introduction to OpenLayers <http://workshops.opengeo.org/openlayers-intro/>`_ - (`Download <http://opengeo.org/products/training/materials/>`_)
  This workshop will show how to create an embedded map, add layers, use controls, add markers and other useful topics for getting started with the OpenLayers JavaScript map component. Updated for OpenLayers 2.13.

`Developing OGC Compliant Web Applications with GeoExt <http://workshops.opengeo.org/geoext/>`_ - (`Download <http://opengeo.org/products/training/materials/>`_/`readme <http://svn.opengeo.org/workshops/projects/geoext/generic_1.1/readme.txt>`_)
  First presented at FOSSGIS 2011, this workshop introduces GeoExt as a web mapping frontend to OGC Web Services (OWS).  Create a map application with a WMS browser, a WFS-T editor, and more.

`Spatial Database Tips and Tricks <http://workshops.opengeo.org/postgis-spatialdbtips/>`_
  How to use the power of spatial databases to make your web mapping applications more powerful. Spatial SQL queries, binding the web to the database, and web architectures.
