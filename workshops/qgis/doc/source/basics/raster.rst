Raster data
===========

#. We can add some raster data by clicking the |raster| icon next to the layer list.

#. Select the ``dem_90m.zip`` file in the ``workshop\downloads`` directory.

#. Save the file as ``dem_90m.tif`` in the ``workshop\data`` directory with the correct **EPSG:4267** CRS.

#. Remove the old file and add the new GeoTIFF to the project.
