Goals for the workshop
======================

The goal of this workshop is to show how to perform spatial analysis with QGIS and then publish the results to a web service. Although this workshop does not assume any basic familiarity with QGIS to complete the exercises, those who are new to QGIS may wish to complete the first few modules of the `QGIS Training Manual <http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/training_manual>`_.

.. admonition:: Training Manual

   Before doing any exercises from the QGIS Training Manual, you will need to `Prepare Exercise Data <http://docs.qgis.org/2.2/en/docs/training_manual/foreword/preparing_data.html>`_. Note that the data used in the Training Manual is not going to be the same as the data we use in this workshop!

By the end of this workshop, you will:

* preparing data for analysis
* be familiar with the processing toolbox
* enable plugins that extend QGIS's analytical functionality
* run processes with custom parameters
* add new processes
* create models to chain multiple processes together
* style the results of our analysis
* use the OpenGeo Explorer to publish maps to GeoServer
