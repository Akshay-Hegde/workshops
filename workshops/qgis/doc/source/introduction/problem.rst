The problem
===========

The analytical goal of this workshop will be to take spatial data describing the physical geography of Wyoming and see how it correlates with seasonal land usage patterns of antelopes in the state. We want to find out if there is a connection between how antelope use the land and characteristics such as elevations, geology and land cover.

The data
--------

We will be using a collection of vector and raster data throughout the course of this workshop.

The `Wyoming Game and Fish Department <http://wgfd.wyo.gov/web2011/wildlife-1000819.aspx>`_ provides some good vector data files on the land usage patterns of a number of species in the state.

Next, we will use some data from the `Wyoming State Geological Survey <http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/data/gis/Geology.aspx>`_ to give us an idea of the geological character of the state.

The `Wyoming Geographic Information Science Center <http://www.uwyo.edu/wygisc/geodata/>`_ provides elevation models of the state that we can use to further analyse the antelope ranges.

In total, for this workshop, we will need the following files:

* `Herd Units <http://wgfd.wyo.gov/web2011/Departments/Wildlife/docs/zipfiles_biggame/Antelope_HuntAreasHerdUnits.zip>`_
* `Surficial 500k <http://www.wsgs.uwyo.edu/data/gis/shapefiles/surgeol_500k.zip>`_
* `Digital Elevation Model for Wyoming 90 meter <http://piney.wygisc.uwyo.edu/data/elevation/dem_90m.zip>`_

Preparation
^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Create a new ``workshop`` directory.

#. Create a ``data`` and a ``downloads`` directory inside ``workshop``.

#. Download the data files into ``workshop\downloads``.

#. Unzip the data in each ``.zip`` file into its own directory inside ``workshop\data``.
