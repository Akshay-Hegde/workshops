GeoExplorer Interface
=====================

Let's launch GeoExplorer and have a look at the user interface.

#. You can access GeoExplorer directly from this URL ``http://localhost:8080/geoexplorer``, or from the Dashboard by clicking on :guilabel:`GeoExplorer`.

   .. note:: The OpenGeo Suite needs to be running in order to access GeoExplorer.
   
The interface is divided into the following sections:

#. The main **Map Panel**
#. The **Toolbar**
#. The **Layers Panel**
