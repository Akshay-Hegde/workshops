Introducing GeoExplorer	
=======================

GeoExplorer is a browser-based interface for composing and publishing web-mapping applications.

Using the latest version of GeoExplorer you can also style your GeoServer layers and edit the data-sources underneath them.

In our evolving diagram of OpenGeo Suite architecture, GeoExplorer sits at the top consuming layers from our local GeoServer whose data sources include the under-lying PostGIS database and file-system.
