Introducing GeoWebCache
=======================

GeoWebCache is a tool that boosts the performance of a WMS by pre-drawing and saving map images for faster responses to client requests. 

In our evolving diagram of the OpenGeo Suite architecture, GeoWebCache sits atop GeoServer's map services brokering map tiles to web-mapping applications in the client tier.
