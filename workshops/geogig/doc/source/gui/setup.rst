Setting up a new project
========================

We have now seen the GeoGig command line interface, and have performed basic management of a geospatial repository with it.

There is also a GeoGig plugin for QGIS, that accomplishes most of the same things, but in a graphical form.

Our goal now is show the exact same workflows we saw in the :ref:`cmd` section, but using the GeoGig plugin for QGIS. As a data administrator, you will then have a choice to use which ever tool makes the most sense for your team.
