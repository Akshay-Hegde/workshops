GeoGig Workshop
===============

Welcome to the GeoGig workshop!

Welcome!
--------

This workshop will introduce attendees to GeoGig, a distributed version control system for geospatial data. We will start with a discussion of distributed version control as applied to the specific case of geospatial data, followed by a hands-on session with the GeoGig command line interface, and finally the graphical GeoGig interface in QGIS. Attendees will learn how GeoGig can be a key tool in a robust and workflow when managing geospatial data.

The workshop is geared toward those with no prior GeoGig experience, but familiarity with basic GIS concepts is suggested. It will be useful to have familiarity with QGIS, the desktop GIS client, along with Git, the distributed version control system, but this is not required.
